# About the CPDLC Research Program

## Our Mission
The CPDLC Research Program aims to improve the pilot experience by developing software that integrates with flight simulation on **X-Plane**. We strive to create tools that make the flying experience more realistic, intuitive, and efficient for pilots.

## Our Tools
- **X-Plane**: Our base flight simulator, which allows us to test and integrate our solutions.
- **Ingescape**: A platform that helps us organize and scale our code by centralizing our various software projects.
- **GitHub**: We use GitHub to manage our codebase, collaborate, and document our work.
