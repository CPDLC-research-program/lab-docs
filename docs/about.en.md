# About the UXFlight

## Our Mission
The UXFlight aims to improve the pilot experience by developing software that integrates with flight simulation on **X-Plane**. We strive to create tools that make the flying experience more realistic, intuitive, and efficient for pilots.

## Our Tools
- **X-Plane**: Our base flight simulator, which allows us to test and integrate our solutions.
- **Ingescape**: A platform that helps us organize and scale our code by centralizing our various software projects.
- **GitHub**: We use GitHub to manage our codebase, collaborate, and document our work.

## Our Objectives
- Enhance flight simulator immersion by developing intuitive interfaces and tools tailored to the needs of pilots.

- Provide a stable and modular software foundation that is easily extensible through a well-structured architecture powered by Ingescape.

- Ensure smooth compatibility and integration of our tools with the X-Plane simulator to enable realistic and reproducible testing.

- Promote open-source collaboration by maintaining clean, well-documented, and version-controlled code on GitHub.

- Create clear and accessible documentation to help new team members and external collaborators quickly get up to speed with our projects.

This website is designed to be a key resource for our team and collaborators, with clear and organized documentation.
