# Welcome to the UXFlight

The **UXFlight** is a research project dedicated to enhancing the pilot experience through innovative software solutions. By using the **X-Plane** flight simulator, we develop and integrate software tools to optimize interactions between pilots and simulation systems.

Our team is working on various software projects, some already operational and others in development. Through the **Ingescape** platform, we centralize and structure our code to make it scalable and ready for evolution. Whether you are a current member, a future intern, or a collaborator, this website is your space to explore our projects, contribute, and collaborate.
